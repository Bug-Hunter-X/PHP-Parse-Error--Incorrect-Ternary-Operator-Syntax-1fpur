This code attempts to use the ternary operator to assign a value based on a condition. However, it uses an incorrect syntax and leads to a parse error. The problem lies in the way the ternary operator is structured.  The correct syntax is `condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false`. In the given code, there's a missing colon (`:`) after the `value_if_true` part, causing the PHP interpreter to fail.

```php
<?php
$x = 5;
$y = ($x > 3 ? 10; : 20); // Incorrect syntax: missing colon
echo $y;
?>
```
